# Ambient Engine V3 Requirements

## New Requirement - Dual Display Highlight Feature

The "highlight" feature for identifying high-value items must work on both:
1. **Phone Screen** - For non-glasses users
2. **HUD (Heads-Up Display)** - For smart glasses users

### Implementation Notes
- Ensure highlight overlays are visible on both display types
- Maintain consistent visual styling across displays
- Consider different screen sizes and resolutions
